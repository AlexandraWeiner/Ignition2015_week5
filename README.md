    - Create a new Rails workspace on C9
    - Add `/.c9` to your `.gitignore` file
    - Setup git and commit the project
      ``` bash
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m ‘initial commit’
      ```
    - Create a new repo on GitHub without a `README` or `.gitignore`
    - Add your remote and push to github (replace the `<username>` and `<repo>` with your username and repo name)
       ``` bash
       git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
       git push -u origin master
       ```
  - As a group, complete the Rails tutorial [Chapter 5](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/filling_in_the_layout#top). Make sure to trade off coding, one person should not write everything.
